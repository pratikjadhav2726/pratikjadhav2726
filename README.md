# Hey there 👋, I'm Pratik Shankar Jadhav

I'm an **AI/ML Engineer** who loves building practical AI systems — the kind that don't just sit on papers, but actually work in production.

By day, I’m architecting scalable **LLM + RAG + Agentic AI** pipelines for enterprise use cases at **UNIS** (3PL / Logistics AI).  
By night (and sometimes weekends), I’m tinkering with **GraphRAG**, **Neo4j-powered tool graphs**, **multimodal AI**, and the occasional diffusion model.

Oh, and I’m also passionate about 🧮 **math**, 🐈 **cats**, and 🤖 **agentic AI**.

## ✨ Fun Facts

- I’m an **AI engineer who still loves pure math** — topology and number theory fascinate me.
- I’ve trained **agents to pick tools smarter than some humans** (I kid… or do I?).
- I believe **Agentic AI** will change how we build software — one tool call at a time.
- I have an unreasonable number of **cat memes** in my downloads folder.
